I got the opportunity this week to attend the 2024 [Powershell Summit](https://www.powershellsummit.org/) in Bellevue Washington.  If you have an opportunity to go to this, whether you're brand new to Powershell or a steely-eyed veteran, I highly recommend it.  
  
Beyond the individual sessions and workshops, the conversations that are had throughout the day in hallways, at tables and even at dinner are invaluable.  I am still a bit overwhelmed but I managed to spend some time since the conference updating my ProtectStrings module.  I wanted to clean up some of the code and also update it to be cross platform.  After the conference I no longer view Powershell as strictly a Windows shell.  Despite having Powershell 7.x installed on my Linux computer I still wrote most of my stuff on a Windows machine and never thought much about using it on Linux.  
After what I saw at the conference I've got a renewed mindset focused on tool making and compatibility.  I hope I get the chance to attend next year as well.
