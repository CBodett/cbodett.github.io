Hello, my name is Courtney Bodett.  I am an IT professional in the Pacific Northwest. I've always been casual tinkerer with many things throughout my life. Curious about how things work, but also a little scared that if I tried to work on anything myself I might break it.  When I was in highschool I decided that I wanted to be a bicycle mechanic and so I went to school to learn how. A short while later I had graduated from a school for this trade and got a job at a local shop turning wrenches.  
I had ridden bikes since I was a kid. I knew what most of the parts did, and how they interacted with each other, and I could ride a bike pretty well.  But the thought of trying to adjust a derailuer on my own, or even just change out a chain was terrifying.  Learning how to actually work on bikes changed all of that and it openened my eyes. Suddenly it didn't matter if it was repairing a bike, swapping a cam gear on a motorcycle, or fixing a dish washer: if I could learn how to do it, it didn't seem that scary.  
Despite this new realization, my experience with computers remained only slightly deeper than casual.  I used them frequently. Played games, edited photos, even tinkered with modding games occassionally. But if you asked me what an IP address was I couldn't tell you.  One summer, late in college, I took a summer job working phone support at a local ISP and installing cable modems.  I quickly learned both how frightening it was to get thrown head first in to something you were unfamiliar with and how rewarding it was to solve a problem.  I was eager to learn everything they were willing to teach me.  I began to learn Vi and Bash and administered some of the Unix servers in house.  
It's been a long journey since then and I still find myself in IT loving it every day.  There's always something new to learn, some problem to solve, some solution to discover for a customer.  I enjoy sharing what I've learned in IT with others and trying to present it in a human understandable way. This blog will serve as a place for me to publish some of my work to share with others.
