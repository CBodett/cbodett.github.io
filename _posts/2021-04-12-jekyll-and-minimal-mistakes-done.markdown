"Hello World" and all that.  What started as a small conversation turned in to an Idea that I couldn't shake: I wanted a blog.  But I didn't want a WordPress blog, having spent too much time scanning WordPress sites for vulnerabilities and always coming up with something I didn't want to be in the same boat.  The idea of static site generation sure sounded like what I wanted and the name "Jekyll" was coming up a lot.  I actually use a project called Joplin for note taking and it uses Markdown, and when I saw that Jekyll was based on Markdown it seemed like a good opportunity to get proficient.  Couple in free hosting on Github and I'm sold. 
So here I am typing out my first blog post using Vi, fingers crossed that when I push it to Github it will look like I expect.  Soon to come are posts about some of the things I've created in Powershell that I found fun and/or useful.
